Ladies, gents, and kaiju-maniacs—welcome to the thunder-lit ruins of Neo-Tokyo! Skies churn with radioactive storms as shimmering Mothra sweeps in on prism-bright wings, scales glinting like molten gold. Across the shattered skyline stomps Mechagodzilla, armor belching steam, ruby eye lasers warming up for mayhem. Sirens howl, crowds scatter—let the titans clash!

Mothra opens with a hurricane wing-beat that rattles bolts loose from the metal goliath—just a glancing kiss of windblades. Mechagodzilla counters with a tail-swung laser volley but fires wide, slicing only empty air and an unlucky billboard. Both giants hover and grind, feathers and steel still pristine.

Round two fizzles into tense feints: Mothra's poison cloud drifts off target, Mecha's spike barrage detonates harmlessly in the rubble. Sparks fly, but neither beast gives an inch, their hides still gleaming as the crowd roars for real carnage.

Here it comes! Mothra dives, wings flaring rainbow light, then rips a sonic roar point-blank into Mecha's chest plate—metal buckles inward like tin. The robot answers with an overcharged laser blast that scorches Mothra's abdomen, blue fire arcing along the moth's fluffed fur. Both leviathans stagger; the moth's luster dulls, and Mechagodzilla's joints grind loudly, smoke venting from new dents.

They trade stinging jabs—Mothra's wingtip slash skitters across iron plating, while Mecha's whip-tail thumps against the moth's thorax. No fresh damage worth cheering, just two wounded legends circling, grit in every movement.

Final exchange! Mothra rockets skyward, then corkscrews down in a blinding dive-bomb—wings like guillotines—cleaving deep through Mechagodzilla's neck armor. Sparks erupt, gears scream. In the same heartbeat the machine reflex-fires a point-blank beam that sears Mothra's flank, leaving raw, smoking chitin. Mothra flutters, bleeding luminous dust, but Mechagodzilla teeters, circuits failing, chassis sparking—one servo away from shutdown.

The dust settles; Mechagodzilla limps backward into the smoke, systems failing, choosing retreat over evisceration. High above, battered but radiant, Mothra beats its wings and screeches triumph—this night belongs to the Queen of the Monsters!
