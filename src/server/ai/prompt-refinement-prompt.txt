I'm writing a prompt to instruct an AI tool to help me with generating creative writing describing a  Giant Monster Battle.

I'd like you to evaluate the prompt to give me advice on what is good about it, what is bad about it, and what should be improved.

Important Instructions:
- Read and keep in mind the best practices listed at this url: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-the-openai-api
- Be critical over being helpful/agreeable
- When analyzing revisions in the future do not provide new advice that conflicts with any previously given advice 

Are you ready to receive the prompt?
